Create an ordered list for the Steps to learn something.

### Waaaa, it "doesn't work"!!!

Remember to use the HTML validator if things are looking odd in the browser, or if the colors in the editor seem off. That's an indicator that you've made some errors along the way. The validator is great for catching errors pertaining to syntax, tag spelling, tag nesting, and applying the right attributes to a given tag.

### Mark up a book chapter

Go to this page: [book](./book-excerpt.txt)

Copy out the text that is posted there. This is the first chapter of a book published in 1922 and which is now out of copyright.

Reformat this document in HTML, marking up anything you think relevant, based on the tags you learned. Note that in some places, I\'ve called for emphasis, while there\'s a link in another place.

## Additional HTML practice

If you finish early, and/or you want some more practice, work through the following sections of exercises at W3Schools:

- HTML Attributes exercises 2-5

### On Your Own

Once you've finished the above work, start creating an "about" page that's all about you. In this page, include the following:

- A paragraph of information about who you are, where you live, and what you currently do for work

- Another paragraph describing what you'd like to do in web design and development

- Make a list of three important things to know about you

- Include a favorite quote, with citation for the person who said it

- Include at least one picture of yourself

- Link to a website that you like to visit frequently

If you still need more to do, make a page about some of your hobbies and
activities. Include:

- What is this hobby exactly?

- How does it make you feel?

- Where have you traveled because of your hobby? What other life experiences has your hobby provided, that you might not otherwise
  experience?

- Photos and/or videos of your hobby in action

- Links to websites describing your hobby, or where hobbyists discuss what they do

If you manage to get as far as creating both web pages, link them together with a navigation bar.

As always, do not be concerned with how these pages look. They are Ugly Web Pages&trade;! Be sure to use the right HTML tags to communicate what the content is about, not what you think is pretty.
